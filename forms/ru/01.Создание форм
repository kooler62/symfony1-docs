Chapter 1 - Form Creation
=========================

A form is made of fields like hidden inputs, text inputs, select boxes, and checkboxes. This chapter introduces you to creating forms and managing form fields using the symfony forms framework.

Symfony 1.1 is required to follow the chapters of this book. You will also need to create a project and a `frontend` application to keep going. Please refer to the introduction for more information on symfony project creation.
